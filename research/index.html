    <p>Most of my work involves  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_modelling_of_infectious_disease" title="mathematical models of infectious diseases">
mathematical models of infectious diseases</a>. I am particularly
interested in the dynamic interaction of diseases with behavioural,
societal, evolutionary and environmental factors, and in computational methods for confronting methods with data. More specific
aspects of my research are listed in the following, see also the
	    list of <a href="publications.html" title="publications">publications</a> for more details.
</p>
<h3>Real-time modelling of infectious disease outbreaks</h3>
<p>During outbreaks of infectious diseases, real-time
modelling can be useful for forecasting case numbers, for
interpreting observed data, and for estimating underlying
epidemiological and biological priorities. We try to use
mathematical models in conjunction with outbreak data to
provide information that can be useful in assessing the
expected scale of an outbreak and a targeted public-health
response.</p>

<h3>Infectious diseases close to elimination</h3>
<p>When infectious diseases come close to being
eliminated, they often behave differently from endemic
diseases. Social mixing patterns can shape the dynamics of
spread if an infection is concentrated in certain parts of
populations. Using mathematical tools, we are trying to
understand these patterns and come up with better
quantification of the feasibility of elimination.</p>

<h3>Vector-borne diseases</h3>
<p><img style="float:right;margin-left:10px" src="/images/contributions.png" /></p>
<p>Vector-borne diseases often have a particularly complex
epidemiology, involving the dynamics of the vector population and
possible animal reservoirs. The ecological and
epidemiological dynamics of both vectors and animal
hosts affect the spread of the disease in human
populations. An example for this is Gambiense Human African
Trypanosomiasis (HAT), a disease transmitted by the tsetse fly and
affecting mostly rural populations in Sub-saharan
Africa. Gambiense HAT has long been known to infect a
variety of
animals, but the exact role these animals play in the
epidemiology of gambiense HAT, and the effect on
disease dynamics in humans, has been a matter of
debate. If animal hosts act as reservoirs, that 
is if they can maintain transmission in the absence of
humans, this can have an important role on efforts to
eliminate or even eradicate the disease.</p>

</p>
<h3>Infectious diseases and human behaviour</h3>
<p><img style="float:right" src="/images/sim_snapshot.png" /></p>
<p>We often change our behaviour in some way or another when we
perceive an infectious disease to be present in our geographical
or social proximity. If we avoid contact with those we perceive to
be contagious, or when we are ill ourselves, this can change the
epidemiology of a disease, and the same can be said for other
types of behaviour like vaccination, medication or wearing face
masks. Behavioural changes are often triggered by the presence of a
disease, but can become independent and be adopted in a population
with its own dynamics separate from the dynamics of the
disease. Disease awareness, beliefs and behavioural practises can
spread in a population through word of mouth or copying others, but
can also be influence of mass media or government
recommendation. All of these factors generate a complex picture
which we need to untangle if we are to understand how diseases
spread in populations. </p>

<h3>Network dynamics</h3>
<p><img style="float:right" src="/images/dynamic_networks.png" /></p>
<p>Networks are used as an abstract formulation for a variety of
scenarios where individual entities of a greater population
interact only some of the other individuals: this can be
individual people in a social network connected by  
friendship or some other kind of relationship, or proteins in a
cell connected by their interaction. While networks have an
important in visualising such relations, they also allow for the
definition and natural interpretation of concepts like clustering
and community structure. In network studies, these relations are
often assumed as fixed. In many situations, however, links get
constantly created and broken up on a continuous basis. I am
interested in the question whether any of the structure that is
identified in static networks can remain stable even if the
evolving nature of the networks is taken into account.</p>

<h3>Global drivers of infectious disease emergence</h3>
<p><img style="float:right;border:1px solid #333333;margin-left:10px" src="/images/global-eids.png" /></p>
<p>Emerging infectious diseases are those which newly appear in humans
(often via evolutionary adaptation of pathogens affecting animals), or which
significantly increase in incidence. When the occurrences of such
diseases over the past decades are plotted on a map, patterns can be observed
which indicate that these are not purely random. In fact, a number of
anthropogenic and environmental factors have been implicated in
disease emergence. My interest is to combine these insights with
mathematical models for the spread of diseases to get a greater
understanding of the processes behind disease emergence and
impact, and of the influence of contact networks at different
stages of emergence.
