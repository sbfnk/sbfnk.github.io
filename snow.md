<p>Animated version of the 1854 Soho outbreak of cholera, famously
investigated
by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow_%28physician%29">John
Snow</a>. The red dots show the current
prevalence of cases which ended in death. Size (area) is
proportional to the number of cases at a given address. The time
of death of each case was randomly chosen on the reported date of
death.</p>

<p>The data was collected from the original records in the Weekly
Registrar General's report, the same data that Snow used in
addition to his own investigations.</p>
